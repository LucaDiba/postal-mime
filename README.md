# postal-mime

Email parser for browser environments.

PostalMime can be run in the main web thread or from Web Workers.

## Source

Source code is available from [Github](https://github.com/postalsys/mime).

## Demo

See this [example](https://kreata.ee/postal-mime/example/).

## Usage

First install the module from npm:

```
$ npm install postal-mime
```

next import the PostalMime class into your script:

```js
import PostalMime from './node_modules/postal-mime/src/postal-mime.js';
```

or when using from a Node.js app

```js
import PostalMime from 'postal-mime';
```

### Promises

All postal-mime methods use Promises, so you need to wait using `await` or wait for the `then()` method to fire until you get the response.

#### Browser

```js
import PostalMime from './node_modules/postal-mime/src/postal-mime.js';

const parser = new PostalMime();
const email = await parser.parse(`Subject: My awesome email ü§ì
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

<p>Hello world üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>`);

console.log(email.subject);
```

#### Node.js

It is pretty much the same as in the browser.

```js
import PostalMime from 'postal-mime';
import util from 'node:util';

const parser = new PostalMime();
const email = await parser.parse(`Subject: My awesome email ü§ì
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

<p>Hello world üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>`);

console.log(util.inspect(email, false, 22, true));
```

#### Cloudflare [Email Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/email-workers/)

Pretty much the same as in Node.js. Use `message.raw` as the raw message for parsing.

```js
import PostalMime from 'postal-mime';

export default {
    async email(message, env, ctx) {
        const parser = new PostalMime();
        const email = await parser.parse(message.raw);

        console.log('Subject: ', email.subject);
        console.log('HTML: ', email.html);
        console.log('Text: ', email.text);
    }
};
```

#### parser.parse()

```js
parser.parse(email) -> Promise
```

Where

-   **email** is the rfc822 formatted email. Either a string, an ArrayBuffer, a Blob object or a Node.js Buffer

> **NB** you can call `parse()` only once. If you need to parse another message, create a new _PostalMime_ object.

This method parses an email message into a structured object with the following properties:

-   **headers** is an array of headers in the same order as found from the message (topmost headers first).
    -   **headers[].key** is lowercase key of the header line, eg. `"dkim-signature"`
    -   **headers[].value** is the unprocessed value of the header line
-   **from**, **sender**, **replyTo** includes a processed object for the corresponding headers
    -   **from.name** is decoded name (empty string if not set)
    -   **from.address** is the email address
-   **deliveredTo**, **returnPath** is the email address from the corresponding header
-   **to**, **cc**, **bcc** includes an array of processed objects for the corresponding headers
    -   **to[].name** is decoded name (empty string if not set)
    -   **to[].address** is the email address
-   **subject** is the email subject line
-   **messageId**, **inReplyTo**, **references** includes the value as found from the corresponding header without any processing
-   **date** is the email sending time formatted as an ISO date string (unless parsing failed and in this case the original value is used)
-   **html** is the HTML content of the message as a string
-   **text** is the plaintext content of the message as a string
-   **attachments** is an array that includes message attachments
    -   **attachment[].filename** is the file name if provided
    -   **attachment[].mimeType** is the MIME type of the attachment
    -   **attachment[].disposition** is either "attachment", "inline" or `null` if disposition was not provided
    -   **attachment[].related** is a boolean value that indicats if this attachment should be treated as embedded image
    -   **attachment[].contentId** is the ID from Content-ID header
    -   **attachment[].content** is an ArrayBuffer that contains the attachment file
